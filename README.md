Installation
----------------
### From CocoaPods

The recommended approach for installating ```ChangelogPresenter``` is via the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) package manager, as it provides flexible dependency management and dead simple installation: 

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
```
Change to the directory of your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/MyProject
$ touch Podfile
$ edit Podfile
```

Edit your Podfile and add ChangelogPresenter:

``` bash
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod 'ChangelogPresenter', '~> 1.0'
```

Install into your Xcode project:

``` bash
$ pod install
```

Open your project in Xcode from the .xcworkspace file (not the usual project file)

``` bash
$ open MyProject.xcworkspace
```

Please note that if your installation fails, it may be because you are installing with a version of Git lower than CocoaPods is expecting. Please ensure that you are running Git >= **1.8.0** by executing `git --version`. You can get a full picture of the installation details by executing `pod install --verbose`.
